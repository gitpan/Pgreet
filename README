NAME
    Pgreet - Perl modules to support the ecard application:
			 Penguin Greetings.


DESCRIPTION
    The Perl modules: Pgreet (Pgreet.pm,) Pgreet::Config
    (Pgreet/Config.pm,) Pgreet::Error (Pgreet/Error.pm,)
    Pgreet::CGIUtils (Pgreet/CGIUtils.pm,) Pgreet:DaemonUtils
    (Pgreet/DaemonUtils.pm,) Pgreet::ExecEmbperl
    (Pgreet/ExecEmbperl.pm,) and Pgreet::ExecMason
    (Pgreet/ExecMason.pm) provide shared functionality for the
    application of the Penguin Greetings ecard application.  Also
    included in this distribution are the files associated with
    Pgreet::I18N (Pgreet/I18N/*.pm) which provide localization for
    most of the Penguin Greetings secondary ecard sites via the Perl
    module: Locale::Maketext.  None of this modules are intended to be
    used by other applications in general.  You can
    learn more about Penguin Greetings (pgreet) at its SourceForge
    site:

		http://pgreet.sourceforge.net/

	POD module documentation is provided for those who might wish
	either to work on Penguin Greetings or adapt these modules to some
	other purpose.

PREREQUISITES
	This module requires the following Perl modules to be installed in
	addition to those included in Perl 5.8.x: Apache::Htpasswd,
	Config::General, Date::Pcalc, Digest::MD5, Embperl,
	I18N::AcceptLanguage, Log::Dispatch, MIME::Lite, String::Checker.
	These are required in order to attempting installing the module at
	all.  There are two other modules that may be needed depending on
	your application: Locale::Maketext and HTML::Mason.  The
	Locale::Maketext is used in all but one of the bilingual Penguin
	Greetings sites, and HTML::Mason is needed for any Penguin
	Greetings sites that use Mason instead of Embperl, such as the
	PgSeattle site.  If you wish to use the test suite to confirm
	functionality of Pgreet module with these two CPAN modules, you
	will need to install them before running the test suite.
	Otherwise the test suite will skip those tests.

INSTALLATION
	Installing these modules to support Penguin Greetings follows
	standard Perl conventions.  One can install the library by running
	the following commands:

	   perl Makefile.PL
	   make
       make test
	   make install

	The "make install" command must be run as superuser (root.)
