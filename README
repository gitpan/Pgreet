			 Penguin Greetings.


DESCRIPTION

    The Perl modules: "Pgreet" (Pgreet.pm,) "Pgreet::Config"
    (Pgreet/Config.pm,) "Pgreet::Error" (Pgreet/Error.pm,)
    Pgreet::CGIUtils (Pgreet/CGIUtils.pm) and Pgreet:DaemonUtils
    (Pgreet/DaemonUtils.pm) provide shared functionality for the
    application of the Penguin Greetings ecard application.  They are
    not intended to be used by other applications in general.  You can

	POD module documentation is provided for those who might wish
	either to work on Penguin Greetings or adapt these modules to some
	other purpose.

INSTALLATION
	Installing these modules to support Penguin Greetings follows
	standard Perl conventions.  One can install the library by running
	the following commands:

	   perl Makefile.PL
	   make
	   make install

	The "make install" command must be run as superuser (root.)  There
	are no tests defined for these modules, although running a "make
	test" does no harm either.
